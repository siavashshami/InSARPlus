polarization: VV+VH

[Region]
# region_type: Choose how to define the region: bounding_box, point_buffer, shapefile, geojson, kml, or kmz
# Only fill the corresponding region definition below; others are ignored to avoid confusion
region_type: bounding_box
# region_folder: Folder where region files (study_area.shp, study_area.geojson, etc.) are stored for shapefile, geojson, kml, or kmz
region_folder: study_area
# bbox_coordinates: For bounding_box; enter lon_min, lat_min, lon_max, lat_max, e.g., 51.0438, 35.5146, 51.6138, 35.8958

# point_buffer: For point_buffer; enter center_lon, center_lat, radius_km, e.g., 51.3515, 35.7053, 15
point_buffer: 
# shapefile: For shapefile; place study_area.shp (with .shx, .dbf) in region_folder, e.g., study_area.shp
shapefile: 
# geojson: For geojson; place study_area.geojson in region_folder, e.g., study_area.geojson
geojson: 
# kml: For kml; place study_area.kml in region_folder, e.g., study_area.kml
kml: 
# kmz: For kmz; place study_area.kmz in region_folder, e.g., study_area.kmz
kmz: 

[Processing]
# min_coverage: Minimum percentage of region coverage required for SLC images (0-100, e.g., 100 for full coverage)
min_coverage: 100
# min_images: Minimum number of SLC images required for time-series analysis (e.g., 10)
